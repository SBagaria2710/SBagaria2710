# Hi there, I'm Shashwat Bagaria 👋

I am a working professional with <u>2.5+ years of experience</u> in building web applications.<br />
Other than my traditional work, I have inclination towards `design, startups, cinema and crypto`.<br />
Let's [connect](#find-me-here) to geek out on any of the topics mentioned 🤓


# 💻 Tech Stack, I've worked with 🧰
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Redux, TypeScript, VueJS, NextJS, Web Technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: Firestore, MongoDB

I, personally, believe programming is more about articulating and organization than picking out a random framework 🤷

# Projects 👷‍♂️

I have had to opportunity to work on multiple projects. Listing some of them 👇
- [Wall.Eth](https://github.com/SBagaria2710/wall.eth): A cryptocurrency project to send crypto around the world.
- [Task Board](https://github.com/SBagaria2710/task-board): Task board for managing task status. Inspired from Notion.
- [Tab Securer](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tab-securer): A browser extension to mark, hide and show private tabs in one click.
