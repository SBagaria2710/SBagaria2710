# Hi there, I'm Shashwat Bagaria ðŸ‘‹

I am a working professional with <u>2+ years of experience</u> in building web applications.<br />
Other than my traditional work, I have inclination towards `design, startups, cinema and crypto`.<br />
Let's [connect](#find-me-here) to geek out on any of the topics mentioned ðŸ¤“


# ðŸ’» Tech Stack, I've worked in...
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Redux, TypeScript, VueJS, NextJS, Web Technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: Firestore, MongoDB

I, personally, believe programming is more about articulating and organization than picking out a random framework ðŸ¤·
