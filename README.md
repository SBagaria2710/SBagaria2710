# Hi there, I'm Shashwat Bagaria 👋

I am a working professional with <u>4 years of experience</u> in building web applications.<br />
Other than my blabbering about web, I also have inclination towards `design, startups and cinema`.<br />
Let's [connect](#find-me-here) to geek out on any of the topics mentioned 🤓


# 💻 Tech Stack, I've worked with 🧰
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Redux, TypeScript, NextJS, VueJS, Flutter, Web Technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Web Performance
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: Firestore, MongoDB

I, personally, believe programming is more about articulating and organization than picking a random framework 🤷

# Projects 👷‍♂️
