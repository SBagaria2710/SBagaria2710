# Hi there, I'm Shashwat Bagaria 👋

I'm a fullstack engineer with **5+ years of experience** building performant, scalable web applications.  
Beyond code, I’m curious about `design`, `startups`, and `cinema`.  
Let's [connect](#lets-connect-) if you'd like to geek out over any of those 🤓

# 💻 Tech Stack I've Worked With 🧰

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Redux, TypeScript, NextJS, VueJS, Flutter, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Performance
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: Firestore, MongoDB

> I believe programming is more about clear articulation and thoughtful structure than simply picking tools 🤷

# Projects 👷‍♂️
